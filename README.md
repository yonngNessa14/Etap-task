This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

### Features?

- View your location, you can zoom in and out.
- You can change the Map type (Satelite or Standard mode).
- Instead of creating a local data set, you can dynamically add more markers(points of interest) by either long pressing any point in the map or using the settings icon to input an address using GoogleAutoComplete.
- You can view real-time location tracking.
- You can stop and resume location tracking
  


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

First, you will need to install dependencies.

To start install dependencies, run the following command from the _root_ of the React Native project:

```bash
yarn install

### For iOS

cd ios && pod install && cd ..

```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
